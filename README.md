# Earthquake prediction

## Introduction
This project is a Python-based machine learning application that predicts earthquake. The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that estimates the earthquake based on various features such as the rift valley, block mountains and lakes  and more.Earthquake prediction is a common and valuable task in the real estate industry, and this project aims to provide insights into what factors influence earthquake.
